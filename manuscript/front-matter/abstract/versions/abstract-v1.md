# Abstract (v1)

We present a multiscale framework for prime localization built from a strict layering of arithmetic constraints (boundedness, wheel sieves, symmetric offset factorization shells), coordinate normalization (log-volume gauge), and spectral residual analysis (log-harmonic decomposition with Euclidean and hyperbolic identity-channel projections). The framework is designed to separate mean-field prime density behavior from structured fluctuations and base-dependent artifacts, using incommensurate scaling schedules (including metallic and plastic ratios) as a de-aliasing device. We formalize a deterministic operator ordering, define quotient-normalized observables across windows and residue compartments, and propose falsifiable criteria by which the construction can be evaluated against classical expectations (prime number theorem behavior, envelope constraints consistent with the Riemann hypothesis, and stability under base and scale changes). The work is offered as a testable program: it aims to refine candidate selection and residual structure diagnostics rather than asserting an unconditional proof of deep conjectures.
