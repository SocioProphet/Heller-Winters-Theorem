# Preface — Synthesis (v0)

## Goal
Merge the strongest features across Preface versions while keeping publication text clean.

## Merge checklist
- [ ] keep “two rails” bridge: elimination-first + log-spectral residual
- [ ] keep narrative cadence (no bibliography clutter in body)
- [ ] ensure every major historical claim is endnoted (v2 standard)
- [ ] add/remove milestones only if they strengthen the backbone of Part II

## Candidate carryovers
- v1 opening tension (discrete vs law)
- v2 bridge paragraph (Preface → Part II operator stack)
