# Preface — A historical restatement of the study of primes (as the backbone of our paper)

Prime numbers enter mathematics first as irreducible multiplicative atoms: integers (>1) that admit no nontrivial factorization. The earliest “theory of primes” is therefore inseparable from the earliest theory of proof about divisibility, because primes are not an empirical category (like “large numbers”) but a logical category (defined by universal negation over divisors). From the beginning, the subject has been a tension between local discreteness (each prime is a stubborn individual) and global law (their distribution exhibits stable large-scale structure).
