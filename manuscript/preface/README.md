# Preface

This node holds versioned Preface drafts and the running synthesis.

## Structure
- `versions/` — immutable snapshots (v1, v2, …)
- `synthesis/` — merge target (“best-of” aggregator)
- `toc/` — local table of contents for this node
- `notes/` — meta notes that must not leak into publication text

## Version policy
- We do not overwrite old versions; we add vN+1.
- We keep citations clean in v2+ (endnotes preferred).
