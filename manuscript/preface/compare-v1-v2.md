# Preface comparison — v1 vs v2

## v1
- Strong historical arc and clear linkage to our method.
- Mixed-quality in-text citations (“(Wikipedia)”/“(WIRED)”) inside narrative.
- Several claims are correct but not citation-disciplined.

## v2
- Same arc, tighter prose, explicit bridge into our construction.
- Removes casual parentheticals; uses endnotes instead.
- Downgrades Wikipedia to index-role (navigation), keeping primary PDFs where possible.
