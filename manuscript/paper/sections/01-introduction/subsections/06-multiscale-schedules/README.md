# 01.6 Multiscale schedules: why metallic and plastic ratios appear

A persistent hazard in prime experimentation is aliasing: artifacts introduced by base representation, fixed periodic partitions, or windowing choices can masquerade as structure. To counter this, we introduce incommensurate scaling schedules—metallic ratios and the plastic constant—as window dilation factors in log-volume. The objective is not to claim that primes are “generated by golden ratios,” but to use irrational scalings as a de-aliasing test: true arithmetic structure should be stable across many incompatible window schedules, while digit-period artifacts should fracture.
