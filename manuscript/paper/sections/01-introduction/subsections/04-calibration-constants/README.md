# 01.4 Calibration constants: Euler–Mascheroni and Euler–Maclaurin as discrete–continuous glue

Any program that mixes discrete counts with continuous approximations must confront systematic offsets between sums and integrals. The Euler–Mascheroni constant (\gamma) is the canonical example: it is the stable offset between the harmonic sum and the logarithm, (\gamma=\lim(H_n-\ln n)). Euler–Maclaurin summation generalizes this phenomenon, decomposing sums into integrals plus boundary and curvature corrections. In this paper, these objects are not decorative historical references: they provide the formal grammar by which “volume laws” (integral terms) and “index regularity” (correction terms) are separated. That separation is essential if we want residual signals to be interpretable rather than merely numerical artifacts.
