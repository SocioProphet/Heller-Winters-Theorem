# 01.7 Contributions and claims of this work

This paper contributes:
1. A strict operator ordering that separates hard admissibility constraints (boundedness, wheel, symmetric shells) from soft spectral scoring and from window schedule design.
2. A unified coordinate model in which number line growth is treated as log-volume, making multiplicative windows the canonical units of analysis.
3. Quotient-normalized observables that align discrete counts with continuous expectations, using Euler–Maclaurin logic to define what is “mean field” versus “residual.”
4. A two-channel (circular/hyperbolic) identity framework for residual analysis, consistent with the RH interpretation as an envelope constraint.
5. A multiscale de-aliasing protocol using metallic and plastic ratio windows to test invariance and isolate base-dependent artifacts.
6. A deterministic phase-gate formalism (derived from the author’s cosine construction) that is meaningful only when its indices are policy-derived rather than freely tuned.

Crucially, we do not claim an unconditional proof of RH or an unconditional closed-form next-prime formula at this stage. We claim a testable, falsifiable construction that can be evaluated by stability under scaling, base change, and residual-envelope diagnostics, and by performance relative to baseline primality search strategies.
