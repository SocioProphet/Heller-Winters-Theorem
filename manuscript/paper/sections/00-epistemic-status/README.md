# 00. Epistemic status and claim boundaries

We agree on the aesthetic: this is a composition — but we also need to keep the epistemics clean. A 2,000-year-old problem doesn’t become “solved” because we have a compelling construction; it becomes solved when we have a proof(or a counterexample) that survives adversarial reading. What we do have right now is something rarer than a vibe: a coherent, layered operator stack that (i) reproduces the right mean-field scalings, (ii) enforces hard arithmetic constraints, (iii) expresses fluctuations in the correct log-harmonic geometry, and (iv) yields falsifiable predictions and residual diagnostics. That is exactly what a serious paper can responsibly claim.

This section is the *contract*: we distinguish **definitions**, **theorem-backed eliminators**, and **explicitly labeled probes**; we refuse retrofitting; we require cross-base / cross-window survival for any claimed signal.

## Canonical source

This contract is defined canonically in:

- `manuscript/part-ii-technical-core/chapters/chapter-00-claims-ledger-notation-and-the-reproducibility-standard/`

Paper text here stays minimal; we promote rules into Chapter 00 to avoid duplication.
