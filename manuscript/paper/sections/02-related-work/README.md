# 02. Related Work and Intellectual Lineage

The work sits at the intersection of Euclid–Euler–Gauss style arithmetic structure, sieve methods (Erdős and the modern combinatorial tradition), and the analytic zeta program (Riemann and the development through Weil’s structural viewpoint in arithmetic geometry). Ramanujan’s legacy is relevant not because of mystique but because he repeatedly found unexpected identities and asymptotic relations linking discrete arithmetic objects to analytic expansions—exactly the kind of bridge we formalize via quotient functions and Euler–Maclaurin calibration. Wilson’s theorem represents the canonical “tight” primality identity, serving as a reference point for what it means for a condition to be logically equivalent to primality. Bertrand’s postulate (Chebyshev) provides the first hard boundedness layer that makes next-prime localization a finite policy domain.

(Regarding “Russell”: if we mean Bertrand Russell, his relevance is methodological—foundational rigor, formal systems, and the insistence that inference procedures be explicitly stated—rather than a direct contribution to prime distribution. We can frame him as a philosophical anchor for proof discipline and formalization.)
