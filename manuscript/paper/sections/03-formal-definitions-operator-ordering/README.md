# 03. Formal Definitions and Operator Ordering

This section is where the composition becomes a machine: definitions of windows, compartments, sieves, quotient observables, identity projections, ratio schedules, and deterministic parameter governance for the cosine phase-gate.

Subsections:
- 03.1 Definitions (windows / compartments / observables)
- 03.2 Deterministic operator ordering (hard eliminators → soft scoring)
- 03.3 Symmetry governance (crystallographic restriction) for periodic compartments
- 03.4 φ / Fibonacci ladder and Zeckendorf triangulation
- 03.5 Integration into the operator stack (paper → canonical spec crosswalk)
- 03.6 Parameter governance for the phase gate (no free knobs)
