# 03.6 Deterministic parameter governance for the phase gate (stub)

This subsection is intentionally a stub until we lock the rule that maps **policy state → phase-gate indices**.
Scientific status depends on this: if (α, k, sectoring) are selectable after the fact, the gate is descriptive; if they’re deterministic functions of state (wheel residue, sector index, Zeckendorf profile, window ladder level), the gate is falsifiable.

Next: specify the state vector, admissible sectorings (CR-policy), and the exact mapping rules; then define falsifiers (cross-base/window failure, drift signatures, ablation outcomes).
