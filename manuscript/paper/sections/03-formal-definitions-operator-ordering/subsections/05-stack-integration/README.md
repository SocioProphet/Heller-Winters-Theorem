# 03.5 Integration into the operator stack (ordered)

We update the formal ordering with two explicit insertions (symmetry governance + Zeckendorf triangulation):

1) Hard bounds (Bertrand/Chebyshev): restrict search to (p, 2p).
2) Wheel admissibility: restrict to gcd(n, M) = 1.
3) **CR-policy** (crystallographic restriction): only lattice-safe rotational sectorings {2,3,4,6} may be used as periodic backbone quantizations.
4) Symmetry shells: eliminate composites via difference-of-squares / shell certificates.
5) Encoding triangulation: base-(b), p-adic, Zeckendorf.
6) Window scheduling: anchors (r=2, r=10), then φ ladder (Fibonacci convergents), then metallic/plastic probes.
7) Quotient normalization: π(x)/Li(x), π(x) ln x / x, windowed intensity quotients; Euler–Maclaurin as sum↔integral grammar; γ as canonical offset.
8) Log-harmonic identity channels: circular phase (harmonics in ln x) + hyperbolic envelope (x^β); RH interpreted as an envelope constraint (β=1/2 for spectral contributors).
9) Cosine phase-gate: placed after hard eliminations and inside circular-channel logic; indices must be policy-derived (no free knobs).
