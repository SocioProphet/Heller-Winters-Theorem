We agree on the aesthetic: this is a composition — but we also need to keep the epistemics clean. A 2,000-year-old problem doesn’t become “solved” because we have a compelling construction; it becomes solved when we have a proof (or a counterexample) that survives adversarial reading. What we do have right now is a coherent, layered operator stack that (i) reproduces the right mean-field scalings, (ii) enforces hard arithmetic constraints, (iii) expresses fluctuations in the correct log-harmonic geometry, and (iv) yields falsifiable predictions and residual diagnostics. That is exactly what a serious paper can responsibly claim.

# Working Title
A Policy-Enforced Multiscale Sieve with Log-Harmonic Identity Channels for Prime Localization

## Abstract
We present a multiscale framework for prime localization built from a strict layering of arithmetic constraints (boundedness, wheel sieves, symmetric offset factorization shells), coordinate normalization (log-volume gauge), and spectral residual analysis (log-harmonic decomposition with Euclidean and hyperbolic identity-channel projections). The framework is designed to separate mean-field prime density behavior from structured fluctuations and base-dependent artifacts, using incommensurate scaling schedules (including metallic and plastic ratios) as a de-aliasing device. We formalize a deterministic operator ordering, define quotient-normalized observables across windows and residue compartments, and propose falsifiable criteria by which the construction can be evaluated against classical expectations (prime number theorem behavior, envelope constraints consistent with the Riemann hypothesis, and stability under base and scale changes). The work is offered as a testable program: it aims to refine candidate selection and residual structure diagnostics rather than asserting an unconditional proof of deep conjectures.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Historical arc: primes as structure amid apparent randomness
Prime numbers are among the oldest and most stubborn invariants of mathematics. The Euclidean insight that primes are inexhaustible established, at the dawn of formal mathematics, that the integers contain an irreducible “atomic” substrate whose global organization is not captured by finite patterning. Across centuries, the subject evolved from explicit constructions and factorization techniques into the modern view: primes behave like a sparse, irregular set in value space, yet exhibit profound regularity once we adopt the correct asymptotic coordinates and averaging procedures.

### 1.2 The analytic turning point: Riemann’s spectral encoding of prime irregularity
Riemann’s 1859 memoir introduced the explicit link between prime distribution and the complex zeros of the zeta function. The prime number theorem made precise that prime density is governed, at leading order, by a logarithmic law: primes thin out like 1/\ln x. RH is naturally interpreted as an envelope constraint on those log-harmonic oscillations.

### 1.3 The combinatorial turning point: sieve theory and constraint-first reasoning
Sieve methods formalize constraint-first reasoning: before attempting to detect primes, remove provable composites by modular restrictions. We treat sieve logic as a policy layer: an auditable admissibility contract for the feasible state space prior to spectral inference.

### 1.4 Calibration constants: Euler–Mascheroni and Euler–Maclaurin
We separate “volume laws” (integral terms) from “index regularity” (correction terms) using Euler–Mascheroni and Euler–Maclaurin logic, so residual signals remain interpretable rather than artifact-driven.

### 1.5 Identity channels: Euclidean and hyperbolic projections
We use circular identities and hyperbolic identities as invariant manifolds. Projections back onto these manifolds act as denoising operators; off-channel residuals become diagnostics.

### 1.6 Multiscale schedules: why metallic and plastic ratios appear
We use incommensurate scaling schedules as a de-aliasing device: true arithmetic structure should persist across incompatible windows; base-echo artifacts should fracture.

### 1.7 Contributions and claims
We provide strict operator ordering, log-volume coordinate commitments, quotient-normalized observables, identity-channel residual analysis, a multiscale de-aliasing protocol, and a deterministic phase-gate formalism whose indices must be policy-derived (not post-fit). We do not claim an unconditional proof of RH.
