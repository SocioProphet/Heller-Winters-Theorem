# Working Title
A Policy-Enforced Multiscale Sieve with Log-Harmonic Identity Channels for Prime Localization

## Abstract
We present a multiscale framework for prime localization built from a strict layering of arithmetic constraints (boundedness, wheel sieves, symmetric offset factorization shells), coordinate normalization (log-volume gauge), and spectral residual analysis (log-harmonic decomposition with Euclidean and hyperbolic identity-channel projections). The framework is designed to separate mean-field prime density behavior from structured fluctuations and base-dependent artifacts, using incommensurate scaling schedules (including metallic and plastic ratios) as a de-aliasing device. We formalize a deterministic operator ordering, define quotient-normalized observables across windows and residue compartments, and propose falsifiable criteria by which the construction can be evaluated against classical expectations (prime number theorem behavior, envelope constraints consistent with the Riemann hypothesis, and stability under base and scale changes). The work is offered as a testable program: it aims to refine candidate selection and residual structure diagnostics rather than asserting an unconditional proof of deep conjectures.

## 1. Introduction (synthesis)

### 1.1–1.7 Core framing
We adopt the v2 introduction as the narrative baseline: (i) primes as local discreteness + global law, (ii) Riemann’s spectral viewpoint as log-harmonic residual geometry, (iii) sieve logic as policy-first admissibility, (iv) Euler–Mascheroni / Euler–Maclaurin as discrete–continuous glue, (v) identity channels as invariant-manifold projections, (vi) irrational window schedules as de-aliasing, and (vii) claims limited to a falsifiable program (not a proof of RH).

### 1.8 Symmetry governance and aperiodic probes (new, folded from v1)
We add two operators that clarify what is “lattice-safe” versus “probe-only.”

**Crystallographic restriction as governance.**  
Any periodic compartment (wheel modulo M, base-(b) digit blocks, periodic residue sectors) that is treated as a discrete lattice must obey crystallographic restriction: allowed rotational sectorings correspond to n in {2,3,4,6}. Sector choices outside this set are not outlawed — they are reclassified as *aperiodic probes* and cannot be used as backbone invariants.

**Zeckendorf as a third coordinate system.**  
In addition to base-(b) encoding (digit periodicity) and p-adic valuation (multiplicative structure), we use Zeckendorf representation (Fibonacci grammar: no consecutive ones) as an additive, constraint-grammar coordinate system on integers. Patterns that survive cross-projection among these coordinate systems are less likely to be representation artifacts.

This turns “ratio schedules” into disciplined de-aliasing: periodic layers are governed (CR-policy), while irrational ladders (φ/Fibonacci, metallic/plastic ratios) are used to stress-test invariance rather than to claim generative numerology.

## 2. Related Work and Lineage (stub)
We sit at the intersection of arithmetic structure (Euclid–Euler–Gauss), sieve methods (constraint-first elimination), and the analytic zeta program (zeros ↔ residuals). This section expands later.

## 3. Next step
We proceed into Formal Definitions and Operator Ordering: windows, compartments, admissibility layers, quotient observables, identity projections, ratio schedules, and a deterministic governance rule set for phase-gate indices.
