**1–120 Sieve Grid with {2,3,5} Elimination + 30-Wheel Overlay**

### Canonical rules
- Domain: integers 1 to 120, laid out in a 10×12 grid, increasing left→right, top→bottom.
- Sieve elimination set: {2,3,5}.
- Eliminated (×): any n with n<2, or n divisible by 2 or 3 or 5, except n∈{2,3,5}.
- Wheel-admissible (□): any n≥2 with gcd(n,30)=1, plus 2,3,5.
- Wheel modulus: M=30.
- Reduced residues: 𝓡₃₀={1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29}. (And operationally we treat {2,3,5} as admissible primes as stated.)

### Canonical legend
- □ = wheel-admissible (candidate corridor)
- × = eliminated by the sieve layer {2,3,5}

### Caption (canonical)
A sieve certifies composites by exclusion. A wheel certifies inadmissible residue classes in advance. Together they form the first deterministic prime engine: fewer candidates, same correctness, explicit reasons.

**30-Wheel Reduced Residues and Repeating Gap Cycle**

𝓡₃₀=(1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29)

Gap cycle (cyclic, mod 30):  
(6,4,2,4,2,4,6,2)

Rendered:

R₃₀ = (1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)  
gap = (6, 4,  2,  4,  2,  4,  6,  2)  repeating every 30

### Caption (canonical)
Wheel generation is walking a periodic step pattern through admissible residues; it is compression without heuristics.

## TYPESETTING SPEC (graphic must match the canonical render exactly)
- Use a monospaced grid or drawn rectangles (10 columns × 12 rows).
- Put each integer centered in its cell.
- If n is eliminated, draw a diagonal slash from lower-left to upper-right.
- If n is wheel-admissible, draw an inner rectangle (halo) inset ~7% from the cell border.
- Legend must include the explicit list 𝓡₃₀={1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29} so the reader can audit instantly.
