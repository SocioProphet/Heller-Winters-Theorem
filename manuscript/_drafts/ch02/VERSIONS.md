We are storing every rendition verbatim for provenance and rollback.

Files
- FIGURES.md
  - Sealed canonical Figure 2.1 (1–120 grid with {2,3,5} + 30-wheel overlay)
  - Sealed canonical Figure 2.2 (R30 residues + repeating gap cycle)

Renditions
- v0-misindexed-log-phase-circle-instrument.md
  - Original “CHAPTER 2” draft that is actually the log-phase instrument + nulls protocol (later mapped to Part II harmonic formalism)
- v1-prime-machines-basic.md
  - Prime machines chapter with wheel as concept (no M=30 worked example)
- v2-prime-machines-m30-microexample.md
  - Adds the M=30 reduced residues, density drop, and repeating gap cycle
- v3-prime-machines-figure-2-1-2-2-integrated.md
  - Adds explicit Figure 2.1 spec and points to sealed Figure package in FIGURES.md
- v4-newton-epigraph-rewrite.md
  - Alternate rewrite + alternate epigraph set (Psalm 111 / John 1 / Newton)
