Got it. We’re rendering the diagrams now, inline, with the micro-annotation baked into the legend (the full \mathcal R_{30} list), so a reader can verify the wheel instantly without hunting.

Below, each entry is printed as:
    •    □ = wheel-admissible (survives divisibility by 2,3,5)
    •    × = eliminated by the sieve layer \{2,3,5\}
    •    (For this specific wheel, anything not wheel-admissible is automatically eliminated by 2 or 3 or 5, except the primes 2,3,5 themselves.)

Figure 2.1 — 1–120 grid with sieve \{2,3,5\} + 30-wheel overlay

Legend (with the required micro-annotation):
    •    slash/strike in the print version = × here
    •    box/halo in the print version = □ here
    •    M=30
    •    \mathcal R_{30}=\{1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29\}
    •    wheel-admissible rule: \gcd(n,30)=1 (and we also keep 2,3,5 as primes)

111× 112× 113□ 114× 115× 116× 117× 118× 119□ 120×

What this figure proves visually (and why we insisted on it):
    •    Admissible \neq prime. Example: 49□ survives \{2,3,5\} but is composite.
    •    The wheel is a correctness-preserving compressor: every × here is eliminated by a certified reason (divisible by 2, 3, or 5).
    •    The □ positions are exactly the “candidate corridor” the wheel hands to deeper operators.

Figure 2.2 — the 30-wheel step cycle (reduced residues + repeating gaps)

\mathcal R_{30}=(1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29)

Compute forward cyclic gaps mod 30:
    •    7-1=6
    •    11-7=4
    •    13-11=2
    •    17-13=4
    •    19-17=2
    •    23-19=4
    •    29-23=6
    •    31-29=2 (wrap, since 31\equiv 1\pmod{30})

So the repeating gap cycle is:

(6,4,2,4,2,4,6,2)

Rendered:

R₃₀ = (1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)
gap = (6, 4,  2,  4,  2,  4,  6,  2)  repeating every 30
