# Drafts-first integration plan (locked)

**Principle:** we never lose text again. Drafts are archived first; TOC/layout comes later.

## What we just locked (2026-01-02)
- Chapter 3: Euler product / log-derivative bridge (verbatim) + Fig 3.2 clean replacement spec
- Chapter 4: Gauss/Legendre mean-field law (verbatim) + Ch04 figure render queue/spec

## Next integration moves (after storage)
1) Pick CURRENT chapter files per chapter and copy into the canonical manuscript location.
2) Only then adjust TOC + subfolder TOCs to match those promoted files.
3) Render queue executes last: generate inline PNGs and commit them as ledgered artifacts.
