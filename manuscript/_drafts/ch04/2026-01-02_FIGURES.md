# Figures — Chapter 4 (locked spec)

## Fig 4.1 — π(x) vs x/log x vs Li(x)
- x-axis: linear or log (declare explicitly); use the same choice across Fig 4.1 and Fig 4.2
- show π(x) as a step function
- show x/log x and Li(x) as smooth comparators
- label residual channel explicitly somewhere in caption: R(x) = π(x) − Li(x)

## Fig 4.2 — Local intensity 1/log x
- plot 1/log x over the same x-range as Fig 4.1
- make “thinning” visually unavoidable

## Fig 4.3 — Window expectation operator
- illustrate [a,b] under curve 1/log t
- annotate ∫_a^b dt/log t as expected prime count (mean-field operator)

## Fig 4.4 — [100,200] micro-example
- single panel, annotated:
  - actual count = 21
  - mean-field ≈ 20
- keep it visually simple and audit-friendly
