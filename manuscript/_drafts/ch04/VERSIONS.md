# Chapter 4 Versions

This folder is an archive of Chapter 4 drafts as they evolved in-chat.

We keep drafts **verbatim** (or explicitly marked “clean/resynth”), then choose a **CURRENT** version when we later promote into the main manuscript.

## Drafts

- **chapter-04-gauss-legendre-meanfield.md**
  - Short pointer file (kept small so navigation stays easy).

- **v0-user-draft-gauss-legendre-mean-field.md**
  - Earlier user draft (pre micro-example; older epigraph set).

- **v1-clean-assistant-draft.md**
  - Assistant-cleaned narrative draft (historical + operator-stack framing).

- **v2-user-ps90-cleobulus-gauss.md**
  - User draft (Psalm 90:12 / Cleobulus / Gauss attribution), includes a hand-checkable window, gap-scale note, and explicit mean-field / residual commitments.

- **v3-resynth-ps90-cleobulus-gauss.md**
  - Resynthesized pacing (“single coherent narrative”), explicitly frames the hand window as calibration, and elevates the residual \(R(x)=\pi(x)-\operatorname{Li}(x)\) as the chapter’s hinge object (bridge to later spectral/explicit-formula chapters).

## Status

- **CURRENT:** v3-resynth-ps90-cleobulus-gauss.md
