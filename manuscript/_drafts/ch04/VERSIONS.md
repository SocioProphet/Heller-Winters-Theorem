# Chapter 4 Versions

This folder is an archive of Chapter 4 drafts as they evolved in-chat.
We keep drafts verbatim, then choose a CURRENT version when we promote into the main manuscript.

## Drafts

- **v0-user-draft-gauss-legendre-mean-field.md**
  - Earlier user draft (pre micro-example; older epigraph set).

- **v1-clean-assistant-draft.md**
  - Assistant-cleaned narrative draft (historical + operator-stack framing).

- **v2-user-ps90-cleobulus-gauss.md**
  - User draft (Psalm 90:12 / Cleobulus / Gauss attribution) with worked micro-example [100,200], gap-scale note, and explicit mean-field/residual commitments.

- **v3-user-ps90-cleobulus-gauss-largewindow.md**
  - Remediation pass: retains the hand-checkable [100,200] window and adds a larger-window verification [100000,200000] with a Li-window estimate, explicitly addressing “small example only” concerns.

## Status

- **CURRENT:** v3-user-ps90-cleobulus-gauss-largewindow.md
