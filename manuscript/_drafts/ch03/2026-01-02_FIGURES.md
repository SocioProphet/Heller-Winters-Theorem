# Figures — Chapter 3 (locked spec)

## Figure 3.2 — Prime Counting Function and Analytic Residual (clean, single, sealed)

**Goal:** single-object plot that separates mean-field from residual without duplicated panels or stray labels.

- x-axis: **log scale**
- left y-axis: **π(x)** and **Li(x)** (counts)
- right y-axis: **residual R(x) = π(x) − Li(x)**
- residual zero line: explicit baseline
- no extra panels, no ghost curves, no ambiguous labels

**Caption discipline:** labels must point to exactly one curve each: π(x), Li(x), and π(x) − Li(x).

**Note:** Chapter 3 may keep this as an architectural schematic; a computed “ledger run” variant can appear later as Fig 3.2b (appendix or later chapter) for audit-grade evidence.
