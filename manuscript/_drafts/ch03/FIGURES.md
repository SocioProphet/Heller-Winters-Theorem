Figure 3.2 — Prime Counting Function and Analytic Residual (replacement spec)

Publication-clean requirements:
- x-axis: log scale
- left y-axis: \pi(x) and \mathrm{Li}(x)
- right y-axis: signed residual \pi(x) - \mathrm{Li}(x)
- explicit zero line for residual
- no extra panels, no ghost curves, no ambiguous labels

Purpose:
- separate mean-field from residual in one readable object.
