## Figure 3.1 — Euler Doorway Schematic (concept diagram)
A single diagram that shows:

- ζ(s)=∑ n^{-s}  (Re(s)>1)
- Euler product: ζ(s)=∏_p (1-p^{-s})^{-1}
- log derivative: -ζ'(s)/ζ(s)=∑ Λ(n)/n^{s}
- interpretation: mean-field ↔ pole at s=1; residual ↔ oscillatory content (zeros)

Deliver as either:
- a clean vector schematic (preferred), or
- a typeset “flow box” diagram in LaTeX/TikZ.

## Figure 3.2 — Mean vs residual (publication plot)
Single clean plot set (no duplicated panels):
- π(x) and Li(x) on the same axes
- residual: π(x)−Li(x) as a separate plot or as a clearly labeled signed overlay

TODO (backlog):
- regenerate Figure 3.2 from scratch with consistent labeling and no stray panel duplication.
