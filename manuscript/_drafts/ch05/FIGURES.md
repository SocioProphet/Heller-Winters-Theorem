# Chapter 5 — Figure specs (render later)

## Fig 5.A — Wheel M=30 (reduced residues)
- Modulus: M = 30
- Reduced residues: {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29}
- Show eliminated spokes (multiples of 2, 3, 5).

## Fig 5.B — Prime rays (residues)
- Plot primes up to an agreed range (e.g., 10^5 or 10^6).
- Color by residue mod 6 (1 vs 5), optionally faceted by mod 4 (1 vs 3).

## Fig 5.C — Survivor density curve
- For P = 2,3,5,7,11,... form M = product_{p<=P} p
- Plot phi(M)/M = product_{p<=P}(1-1/p) vs P (log scale for P).

## Fig 5.D — Character basis schematic (conceptual)
- Depict Dirichlet characters as orthogonal “channels” over (Z/qZ)^×.
- Show mapping: residues → characters → L(s,chi).
