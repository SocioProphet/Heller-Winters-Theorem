# Draft Archive (verbatim snapshots)

This folder stores draft versions *verbatim* as they appeared in chat.
Priority rule: STORE FIRST, then remediate TOC/subfolder placement later.

Conventions:
- Each chapter has its own folder: ch02/, ch03/, ch04/, ch25/, etc.
- FIGURES.md holds the sealed, canonical figure packages.
- VERSIONS.md indexes variants and declares which one is CURRENT (when chosen).
