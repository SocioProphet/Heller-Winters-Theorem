Backlog: Chapter 1 needs TOC-consistent framing adjustments, but we should not rewrite until Chapter 2 is locked.

Notes:
- Ensure Chapter 1 does NOT treat the log-circle as the first experiment (that belongs later with controls)
- Chapter 1 should function as Part II on-ramp: thesis posture + coordinate/window discipline; keep experiment protocol centralized later
- Track edits as issues; defer execution until Chapter 2 is stable
