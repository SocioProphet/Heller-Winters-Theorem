# Paper → Operator Stack Crosswalk

## Paper
- 00 Epistemic status → (global governance contract)
- 01 Introduction → (links into the operator chapters)
- 02 Related work → (lineage only)
- 03 Formal definitions + ordering → canonical definitions + governance

## Canonical operator lane (targets)
- Chapter 05 Wheel Sieve Layer → CRT-policy governance (periodic compartments)
- Chapter 08 Base-(b) Compartmentalization → Zeckendorf triangulation axis
- Chapter 13 Ratio Families → φ ladder scheduling / irrational de-alias probes
- Chapter 18 Phase Gate → deterministic parameter governance (no free knobs)

(We fill exact section/subsection pointers as we promote text from paper lane into canonical operator nodes.)
