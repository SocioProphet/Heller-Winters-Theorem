# Chapter 00 — Claims Ledger, Notation, and the Reproducibility Standard

This chapter is the spine that prevents us from lying to ourselves.

It defines:
- the **claims taxonomy** (A/B/C/D),
- minimal **notation discipline**,
- the **prime-to-geometry template** (θ, Φ, wrapped phase),
- the **reproducibility contract**, and
- required **null models / stress tests**.

Edits must remain surgical: each subsection lives in its own section folder.
