# 00.6 Reproducibility Contract

Every result in this book must specify:

1) **Prime selection:**  
- by value range \([p_a,p_b]\) or by index range \([n_a,n_b]\)

2) **Transformation:**  
- the exact formula for \(\theta(p)\) (or the intermediate scalar that becomes \(\theta\))

3) **Wrapping / normalization:**  
- exact rule for \(\bmod 2\pi\), scaling, or saturation

4) **Rendering:**  
- scatter vs density vs histogram vs cumulative

If any of the above are missing, the figure is an illustration—not evidence.
