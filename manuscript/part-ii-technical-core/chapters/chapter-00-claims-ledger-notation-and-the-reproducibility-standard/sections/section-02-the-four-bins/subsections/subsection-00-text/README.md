# 0.2 The Four Bins

(A) **Definitions**  
Objects we define precisely so there is no ambiguity.

(B) **Theorems / Proofs**  
Statements proved deductively from stated assumptions.

(C) **Empirical Regularities**  
Patterns observed in computation or plots. Repeatable experiments. These are not proofs.

(D) **Heuristics / Interpretations**  
Narratives and intuition-guides. Helpful for insight; never used as proof.

Every claim in the manuscript is tagged A/B/C/D at first appearance.
