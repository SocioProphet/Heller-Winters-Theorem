# 00.0 Epigraph and introductory visualization

## Hebrew (עִבְרִית)
בַּקְּשׁוּ אֶת־הָאֱמֶת וְאַל־תִּירְאוּ לִבְחֹן אֶת־דַּרְכֵּיכֶם׃  
Seek truth, and do not fear to test your ways.

## Greek (Ἑλληνικά)
ζητεῖτε τὴν ἀλήθειαν· τὸ δὲ δοκιμάζειν ἔργον ἀγάπης ἐστίν.  
Seek truth; and testing is the work of love.

## English
Truth that cannot be checked is only a story. Truth that can be checked becomes a tool.

**“Prime Ladder on the Log Line”**  
A clean strip-plot of the first **N** primes on a logarithmic axis, with tick-marks at **10^k**.

The point is not beauty—it is orientation: primes are sparse, growth is nonlinear, and our “natural” linear intuition is the wrong ruler.

**Caption:** Before we build phase, circle, or spectrum, we set the scale: primes live most naturally on the log line.
