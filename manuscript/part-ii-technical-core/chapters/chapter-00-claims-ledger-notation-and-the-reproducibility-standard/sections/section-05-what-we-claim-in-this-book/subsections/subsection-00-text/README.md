# 0.5 What We Claim in This Book

**A-claims (definitions we commit to)**  
A1: Every plot corresponds to an explicit \theta(p) and an explicit prime range.  
A2: Every figure can be reproduced from text alone.

**C-claims (empirical observations, not yet proofs)**  
C1: Certain log-circle embeddings produce stable geometric structure across large prime windows.  
C2: Certain phase constructions preserve non-random clustering under multiple controls.

**B-claims (what must be proved to earn theorem-status)**  
B1: If a structural claim is asserted as theorem-grade, it must be deduced from stated assumptions and validated against counterexamples.  
B2: Any “regularity” must survive a null model and a stress test (below).

**Not claimed:** We do not claim naïve periodicity of primes. We do not claim a picture is a proof. We do not claim an operator is meaningful unless it survives a control.
