# 00.8 The Claims Ledger Table

In each chapter, we maintain a small ledger:

- Definition used (explicit formula)  
- What it predicts (structure type)  
- Which tests it passes (N1/N2/S1/S2/S3)  
- Status (A/B/C/D)

This turns the book into a machine: every chapter either upgrades claims or discards them.
