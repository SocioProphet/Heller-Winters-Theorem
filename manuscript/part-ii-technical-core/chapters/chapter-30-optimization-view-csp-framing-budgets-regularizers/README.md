# Chapter 30 — Optimization View (CSP framing; budgets; regularizers)

This chapter is structured for surgical diffs:

- `toc/TOC.md` is the chapter-local map.
- `sections/` contains isolated sections.
- Each section contains `subsections/` for smallest-grain edits.

Every nontrivial claim is tagged A/B/C/D at first appearance and logged using:
- `manuscript/templates/claims-ledger-template.md`
