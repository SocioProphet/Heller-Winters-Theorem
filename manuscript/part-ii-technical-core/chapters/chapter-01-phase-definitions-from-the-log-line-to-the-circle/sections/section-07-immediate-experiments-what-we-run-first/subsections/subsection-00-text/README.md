# 1.7 Immediate Experiments (what we run first)

Using the three baseline embeddings \Phi_{\log},\Phi_{\log\log},\Phi_{\mathrm{idx}}, we produce:

1) Circle scatter of \Phi(p) for a fixed prime window  
2) Angle histogram of r(p) on [0,2\pi)  
3) Window comparison: same plots over increasing ranges [n_a,n_b]\to[n_a,10n_b]  
4) Nulls: repeat with random odd integers and random phases  

The goal is not to “win” in Chapter 01. The goal is to establish what a real signal must survive.
