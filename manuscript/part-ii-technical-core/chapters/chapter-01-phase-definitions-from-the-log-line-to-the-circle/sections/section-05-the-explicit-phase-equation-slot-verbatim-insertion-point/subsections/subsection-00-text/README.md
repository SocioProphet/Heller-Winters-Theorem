# 1.5 The Explicit Phase Equation Slot (verbatim insertion point)

This section is reserved for the explicit phase equation as it appears in the original notes. In this manuscript it will be inserted verbatim, then immediately normalized into a unit-clean form (radians, consistent wrapping, defined domain).

**Equation 1.5.A (verbatim form).**  
\theta_{\star}(p)=\;\;\text{[INSERT EQUATION EXACTLY AS WRITTEN IN NOTES]}

**Normalization rule (applied once, immediately).**

- All angles expressed in degrees are converted to radians via \theta^\circ \mapsto \theta\cdot\pi/180.  
- Any constant like 90^\circ is rewritten as \pi/2.  
- Any wrapping is stated as \bmod 2\pi.  
- Any indexing variable k is defined explicitly: whether it refers to prime index n, residue class index, or another deterministic traversal.

This guarantees the equation becomes a reproducible operator rather than a handwritten artifact.
