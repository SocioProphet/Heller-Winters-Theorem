# 1.3 Hyperbolic Coupling Layer (bridge operator)

This layer formalizes the conceptual bridge used throughout the work: a phase variable (circular, bounded) can be paired with an “amplitude-like” variable (unbounded), producing a controlled way to fuse circular and hyperbolic behavior.

Define a pair:
u(p)=\cos(r(p)),\qquad v(p)=\sin(r(p))

and a hyperbolic amplitude:
a(p)=\cosh(x(p)),\qquad b(p)=\sinh(x(p))

We then build coupled invariants such as:
I_1(p)=a(p)\,u(p)=\cosh(x(p))\cos(r(p))
I_2(p)=b(p)\,v(p)=\sinh(x(p))\sin(r(p))

These are not proof objects. They are measuring tools: they let us test whether the same prime-derived transform x(p) carries coherent signal in both bounded and unbounded channels.
