# Chapter 01 — Epigraphs and Introductory Visualization

Hebrew (עִבְרִית)  
פִּתְחוּ לִי שַׁעֲרֵי־צֶדֶק; אָבֹא־בָם, אוֹדֶה יָהּ׃  
Open to us the gates of righteousness; we enter and give thanks.

Greek (Ἑλληνικά)  
ὁ λόγος ἐστὶν ἀρχή· καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ζητεῖ τάξιν.  
The Logos is beginning; and beginning seeks order.

English  
We do not guess our way into truth. We define. We compute. We test. Then we speak.

## Introductory Visualization for Chapter 01

**“The Log-Circle Map of Primes”**  
Plot each prime p as a point on the unit circle using  
\Phi_{\log}(p)=e^{i(\log p \bmod 2\pi)}.  
This is the base instrument: the simplest log-phase embedding. Everything else in the chapter is a refinement, control, or alternative phase choice.

**Caption:** The circle is not decoration—it is a phase instrument. The question is whether primes leave a fingerprint after wrapping.
