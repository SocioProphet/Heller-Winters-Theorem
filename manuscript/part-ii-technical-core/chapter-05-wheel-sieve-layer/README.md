# Chapter 05 — Wheel Sieve Layer

We formalize wheel sieves as modular admissibility filters: candidates must be coprime to a chosen modulus M. Wheels eliminate composite volume cheaply and provide stable periodic structure via residue classes. We treat wheel selection as a policy decision balancing pruning power and overhead, including resonance risk with base partitions. Residue classes also serve as state labels for later symmetry governance. Wheel is deterministic elimination, not prediction, and we keep that separation explicit.
