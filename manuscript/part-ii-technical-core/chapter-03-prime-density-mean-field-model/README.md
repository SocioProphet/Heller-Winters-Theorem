# Chapter 03 — Prime Density Mean-Field Model

We restate the mean-field picture: density about 1/ln x and cumulative count about x/ln x. Any candidate reduction must preserve this baseline rather than hallucinate structure. We frame distribution as mean field plus residual; the residual is where spectral content lives. We use windowed expectations via ∫ dt/ln t rather than raw counts. This chapter sets guardrails for later operators.
