# Chapter 02 — Canonical Coordinate System

We formalize coordinate choices that make volume measurable and scale comparisons meaningful. We use u = ln x so multiplicative growth becomes additive translation and window schedules become fixed log-lengths. Base change becomes linear frequency rescaling in the log-harmonic picture, so cross-base persistence is a strong anti-artifact test. We separate index space, value space, and policy/state space to avoid category errors. We define normalization conventions so comparisons across scales are meaningful.
