# Chapter 04 — Boundedness Layer

We formalize the doubling bound guaranteeing a prime in (n,2n), giving a finite search interval for the next prime after p. This converts localization from unbounded to bounded policy space. We treat the bound as the outer enclosure that all other sieves act inside. In log-window language it becomes a fixed log-length cell L = ln 2 around u = ln p. The bound is scaffold, not solution, so we record its failure modes explicitly.
