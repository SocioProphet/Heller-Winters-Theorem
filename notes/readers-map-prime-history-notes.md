# Notes — Reader’s Map prime-history draft (prepublication)

This file is intentionally *not* part of the manuscript body. It’s our drafting ledger: critique, sourcing gaps, and concrete upgrade steps.

## Self-critique (so we tighten it)

### What’s strong here
- The narrative spine is historically accurate: Euclid → sieve → ζ(s)/PNT → RH → sieves/probabilistic method → bounded gaps, with credible sources at the load-bearing points.
- Erdős is handled in a way that’s human but not defamatory: we describe blunt/abrasive via reputable biography review framing and avoid turning it into character assassination.
- It tees up our methodology without claiming victory on RH (which we must not do without proof).

### What’s weaker / needs refinement
- Some citations are draft-grade (e.g., “personal pages,” secondary retellings). For a final manuscript we should cite primary/curated sources wherever possible.
- We still want the missing milestone stitches (Dirichlet arithmetic progressions, Chebyshev bounds / Bertrand enclosure, Selberg–Erdős elementary PNT tensions, modern computational primality like AKS) either in a sidebar, endnotes, or a short timeline appendix.
- If we include colorful anecdotes (e.g., the “fascist kitten” lore), we should source them from a legitimate publication edition or an academically curated excerpt—not loose retellings.

## Concrete upgrade path
1. Replace draft citations with stable editions: Euclid translation/edition; Riemann 1859 archival citation; Hadamard + de la Vallée Poussin 1896 references; Zhang 2013 + Maynard 2015 + Polymath pages.
2. Add a one-page “Prime Milestones Timeline” appendix: Euclid, Eratosthenes, Euler product, Dirichlet, Riemann 1859, Hadamard/Vallée Poussin 1896, Selberg/Erdős elementary PNT, modern sieve breakthroughs, AKS, Green–Tao, Zhang/Maynard/Tao.
3. Keep the Reader’s Map doing only orientation + stakes; push detailed technical claims about our construction (means, bases, policy operators) into early core chapters so the front matter stays readable and defensible.
