# TOC — Synthesis v4 (book container + executable technical core) — prepublication

This synthesis preserves the book container (front matter, Preface, history, appendices) while keeping the technical core as an auditable operator stack with explicit falsifiers and drift tests.

## Front Matter
- Title Page
- Copyright
- Author’s Introduction (God-only dedication; canonical)
- Preface (canonical prime-history + collaborator credits; canonical)
- Acknowledgments
- Author Contributions Ledger (role-by-role, claim-by-claim)
- Notation, Conventions, and Operator Legend
- Reader’s Map
  - What is proven vs definitional vs empirical vs conjectural
  - Operator contract: eliminator vs coordinate change vs labeled heuristic probe
  - Audit contract: every claim has falsifiers, drift tests, and ledger placement

## Part I — Ancestry of Constraints (history as operator genealogy)
1. Zero, Representation, and the Birth of Number as Structure
2. Euclid and the First Invariants (infinitude; proof posture)
3. Eratosthenes and Sieve Thinking (elimination as computation)
4. Euler: Products, Series, and the Analytic Doorway
5. Gauss, Legendre, and the Mean-Field Law (density as geometry)
6. Dirichlet: Progressions and Residue-Class Symmetry
7. Chebyshev: Universal Enclosures and First Practical Bounds
8. Riemann: Explicit Formula, Zeta Zeros, Log-Scale Oscillation
9. Hardy–Littlewood: Constellations, Heuristics, and Correlation
10. Modern Sieves and Breakthroughs (tooling limits, what remains hard)
