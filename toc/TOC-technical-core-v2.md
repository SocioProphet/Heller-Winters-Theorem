# TOC — Technical Core Draft v2 (refined) — prepublication

This draft refines v1 by tightening governance language:
every operator is either (i) a theorem-backed eliminator, (ii) a coordinate change, or (iii) an explicitly labeled heuristic probe.

(For now we store the same structural Chapter 6–23 block; we will expand v2 deltas per-chapter next pass.)
