# TOC comparison — v0 book TOC vs v1 technical-core TOC (prepublication)

## Summary
- v0 (TOC-prepublication-v0.md) is a full book frame: Front Matter + Preface + Part I history + Part II technical core + Appendices.
- v1 (the “resynthesized TOC” draft) is effectively v0 Part II rewritten as a paper-first spine:
  - renumbered to start at Chapter 1,
  - expanded with chapter overview prose and subtopic discussions (esp. Chapters 1–6),
  - omits Front Matter/Preface/Part I/Appendices.

## Structural coverage deltas
### Present in v0, missing in v1
- Front Matter block (Title/Copyright/Dedication/Epigraph/Acknowledgments/Contrib Ledger/Notation/Reader’s Map)
- Preface (4 parts)
- Part I — Ancestry of Constraints (history chapters 1–10)
- Appendices A–F (timeline, toolbox genealogy, ledger templates, glossary, reproducibility checklist, index)

### Present in v1, minimal or implied in v0
- Paper-style chapter discussions (4–6 sentence chapter overviews; expanded subtopic prose for Chapters 1–6)
- Stronger early emphasis on falsifiability, invariance, and constraint propagation posture
- Explicit “units/normalization/invariance” emphasis as a core operator object
- New-ish vocabulary: crystallographic governance; cosine phase-gate naming; Zeckendorf triangulation mention

## Mapping (v1 chapter -> v0 chapter)
- 1 -> 11 (Purpose/Thesis)
- 2 -> 12 (Canonical Coordinate System)
- 3 -> 13 (Mean-field density)
- 4 -> 14 (Boundedness)
- 5 -> 15 (Wheel sieve)
- 6 -> 16 (Symmetric offsets)
- 7 -> 17 (Figurate lattices)
- 8 -> 18 (Base compartments)
- 9 -> 19 ((p)-adic layer)
- 10 -> 20 (Quotients/normalization)
- 11 -> 21 (Euler–Mascheroni)
- 12 -> 22 (Euler–Maclaurin)
- 13 -> 23 (Ratio families)
- 14 -> 24 (Ratio governance)
- 15 -> 25 (Harmonic signature)
- 16 -> 26 (Identity channels)
- 17 -> 27 (RH envelope constraint)
- 18 -> 28 (Phase operator)
- 19 -> 29 (Structural sieves beyond wheel)
- 20 -> 30 (Optimization view)
- 21 -> 31 (Classical theorems as policy operators)
- 22 -> 32 (Evidence ledger + falsification)
- 23 -> 33 (Consolidated spec + extensions)

## Key semantic diffs inside overlaps
1) Phase operator specificity
- v0 explicitly includes the (90/11) normalization component + ablations + cross-base and cross-window survival requirements.
- v1 uses “cosine phase-gate operator” framing with stronger governance posture, but currently omits the (90/11) commitment unless re-injected.

2) Governance framing promoted
- v1 promotes lattice-safe / crystallographic governance earlier (roadmap + repeated constraints), making the symmetry rationale harder to misread as numerology.

3) Claim taxonomy placement
- v0 places proven/definitional/empirical/conjectural in Front Matter (Reader’s Map).
- v1 places scope limits + falsifiers early (Chapter 1) and relies on the ledger chapter later.

## Intended roles (recommended)
- v0 remains the book TOC (narrative + lineage + machine + appendices).
- v1 becomes the technical-core/paper-first TOC: we can port its expanded chapter prose into v0 Part II while keeping v0’s front matter, Part I history, and appendices.
