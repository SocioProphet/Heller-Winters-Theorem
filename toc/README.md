# TOCs (prepublication)

This directory intentionally contains multiple, competing Table of Contents drafts for the manuscript.

- This is **prepublication** material: structure and ordering are expected to change.
- Do **not** assume any TOC here is canonical unless it is explicitly labeled as such.
- Naming convention:
  - `TOC-prepublication-v#.md` = working drafts
  - `TOC-<tag>-<YYYYMMDD>.md` = alternates (e.g., `technical-first`, `narrative-first`, `journal-submission`)

Note: the root-level `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` is for repository navigation, not manuscript structure.
