# Table of Contents drafts (prepublication)

This directory intentionally contains competing TOC drafts.

Rationale:
- The manuscript is prepublication and evolving.
- Different TOCs serve different purposes (book-first vs paper-first vs technical-core vs pedagogy).
- We preserve drafts to avoid losing design intent and to keep provenance/auditability.

Files:
- TOC-technical-core-v1.md
- TOC-technical-core-v2.md
- TOC-synthesis-v3.md
- TOC-compare-v0-v1-v2-v3.md
