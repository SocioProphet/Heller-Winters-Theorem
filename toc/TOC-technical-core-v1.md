# TOC — Technical Core Draft v1 (paper-first spine) — prepublication

(Stored from our chat draft; chapter overviews + subtopic lists.)

Chapter 6 — Symmetric Offset Algebra
We formalize symmetric-offset identities (difference-of-squares and shell families) that yield composite certificates and connect factor pairs to additive geometry. Parity constraints determine when decompositions exist, providing cheap policy filters. Shell families can be analyzed statistically in log windows, producing both eliminators and features. Hyperbola geometry (ab=n) in rotated coordinates links naturally to hyperbolic identity-channel reasoning later. Shell enforcement is positioned as structural noise reduction.
Subtopics: difference-of-squares; neighbor shell; general shells; factor-pair mapping; parity constraints; certificates; shell density scaling; log-window shell stats; wheel+shell interaction; structural noise reduction.
